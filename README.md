# Travelogue-R.Payette
Travelogue Assignment - Web Communications 

**This is an individual assignment.**

## Instructions

Create a web page that details three locations you particularly enjoy. These could be international vacation destinations, or different locations in a city. Write at least one paragraph about each location: what do you enjoy about them? What information would be important to give to someone who has never visited these places, but is interested in doing so?

This travelogue should include:

- A header and footer
- An appropriate title and heading
- At least three:
- Images (photos, illustrations, etc.) created by you: one image for each location.
- Substantial paragraphs (i.e. a paragraph that is four or more sentences long) of original, unique content: a minimum of one paragraph for each location.
- Any other content about the locations you feel may be relevant to the reader.

Your HTML should be **valid and semantic**, using the best HTML elements for the content you're marking up and reserving <div> as a container of last resort. Use valid CSS to improve the presentation of the page, written in a linked style sheet. The design you create should complement the content on the page and help tell your story. Consider how your design will augment the text and images on the page and what design elements you can add (such as custom fonts).

All HTML, CSS, text and media on the page should be unique and created by you. You should be able to explain the purpose of all the HTML and CSS used on the page. Do not copy code from other sources, and do not use frameworks or Large Language Models ("AI") to generate your code.

The page's total file size - images, text content, and code combined - should be no more than 1.2 MB.

## Deliverables
Create a new Github repository with a relevant name, such as cprg-218-travelogue, make sure the repository is marked Public (not Private) and enable Github Pages for this repository. Be sure your page is named index.html so that it appears as the homepage for your Github Pages site.

In the Comment for your submission, include your Github repo URL and the link to your website on GitHub Pages. Do not modify your GitHub repository after the assignment due date until this assignment has been marked (you can fork the repository if you wish to continue to iterate).

As well, attach an attributions document to this assignment named attributions.pdf. If all work is original, your document should state "All work is original".

### Attributions & References
Attributions and citations for your project and any resources should be included with this assignment. No citations in a work should result in a citation document with words to that effect. Refer to the attribution document attached. 

### Originality
All work submitted for this assignment must be original. Re-submission of previously submitted work (for example, from a previously failed class) or work developed for another course will be considered self-plagiarism, unless noted in the exceptions below. Plagiarism of any kind will result in an automatic 0 mark for the assignment and initiate an Academic Misconduct investigation.

### Originality Exceptions
If you do not have appropriate images of your travelogue locations, you may use Creative Commons or similarly licensed open-source photographs to illustrate your HTML document. If you do so, you must follow the conditions of the image's license and include the image's source in your attributions document.
