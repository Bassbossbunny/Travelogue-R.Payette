                A Calgary Friday Night Ritual
            </h2>
            <p>
                When we first moved to Calgary, we found ourselves drawn to the vibrant downtown scene, eager to carve out our own tradition. What started as an occasional outing soon became a cherished ritual—one that gave us an excuse to dress up, unwind, and savor the evening with friends. It’s become more than just a night out; it’s a celebration of good drinks, great company, and the city we now call home.
            </p>
        
            <p>Our ritual usually kicks off at <strong>Betty Lou's Library </strong>Speakeasy, a hidden gem with a 1920’s-era theme that feels like stepping back in time. With its dim lighting, vintage décor, and expertly crafted cocktails, it’s the perfect place to set the mood for the evening. We usually get a reservation from 6:00pm to 8:00pm <em>(they do have a two-hour maximum, after all)</em>, which is just enough time to enjoy a couple of their signature drinks and soak in the intimate ambiance. </p>
        
            <p>After that, we head to <strong>Ricardo’s Hideaway</strong>, a tropics-inspired rum bar that transports us straight to an island oasis. The menu here features genuine renditions of classic rum and mezcal cocktails, each one thoughtfully crafted and bursting with flavor. If you’re a fan of daiquiris, you’re in for a treat—their version is hands-down the <em>best</em>!</p>
        
            <p>To cap it off, we make our way to <strong>Añejo</strong>, a lively Mexican restaurant and bar specializing in tequila and offering an array of signature margaritas. From the moment we walk in, we’re greeted by the vibrant atmosphere and delicious smells of fresh tacos. Their "Halfy-hour," where tacos and margaritas are half off after 9:00pm, is the perfect way to end the night on a high note.</p>
        
            <p>This little tradition has become our favorite way to slow down the week, and while it’s evolved over time, it remains a simple joy we look forward to each month. Whether you’re new to Calgary or a long-time local, it’s a ritual that’s sure to make you fall in love with the city’s nightlife just as we did.</p>

                <p>Don’t let the "Tiki bar" label fool you, Ricardo's Hideaway is far from the sugary, gimmicky spots you might find in tourist traps. This is a sophisticated rum bar that pays genuine homage to the classic cocktails of the Caribbean and beyond. With a modern, mid-century flair in the décor, Ricardo’s blends an authentic island vibe with a stylish, contemporary twist. The space is inviting yet refined, with tropical touches that feel like a sophisticated nod to a bygone era of cocktail culture. </p>

                <p>What truly sets Ricardo’s apart is their unwavering commitment to quality. Each drink is a carefully crafted masterpiece, made with balanced flavors that honor the traditions of tiki while avoiding the pitfalls of overly sweet, watered-down concoctions. As any seasoned cocktail enthusiast will tell you, you can judge the skill of a bartender by their ability to make a classic drink, and at Ricardo's, their daiquiri is the gold standard. Clean, crisp, and perfectly balanced, it’s arguably the best coconut daiquiri you’ll ever taste—a smooth, refreshing drink that highlights the skill and care that goes into each cocktail. </p>

                <p>While rum is the star of the show, Ricardo's also offers a curated selection of gin and mezcal tequila for those who like to mix things up. But it’s the rum that steals the spotlight, with cocktails that evoke the spirit of the islands without resorting to the overly sweet, gimmicky flavors often associated with tiki drinks.</p>

                <p>At Ricardo’s, it’s all about authenticity, craftsmanship, and the art of the perfect pour. Whether you’re a rum aficionado or just looking for a stylish spot to enjoy a well-made drink, Ricardo’s Hideaway delivers an unforgettable experience with every sip.</p>
