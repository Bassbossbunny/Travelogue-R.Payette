            hello. CHANGE THIS LATER. Talk about our "ritual" for occassional fridays in downtown calgary. Start with Betty lou's Library Speakeasy. reservation from 6:30pm-8:30pm as they have a two-hour maximum stay. then go to Ricardo's Hideaway for a few cocktails. they have the best daiquiris. Then off to Añejo's from 9:00pm-11:00pm for "Halfy-hour" where tacos and margaritas are half off after 9. 

            Perhaps just talke about the ritual and how it originated, when we moved to calgary and how we came to make our own "tradition" so to speak.

                Talk about the quality and committment to genuine renditions of classic cocktails. How you can tell if a bartender is "worth their salt" by the quality and clarity of a classic, true-to-form daquiri. 

                Best coconut daquiri I have had the pleasure of tasting.
                Ricardo's typically uses Rum for their cocktails, but also have a smalll curated selection of gin and mezcal tequila.

            Discuss the fresh guacamole, immense tequila selection, and excellent tacos. Halfy-hour makes dining here very cost-efective, with $3.00 tacos and $6.00 margaritas. Añejo's it creates a lively atmosphere with vibrant decor and passionate staff. This is usually our go-to place when hanging out with friends and colleagues on a friday night. you do, however, need a reservation if you want to be able to experience halfy-hour on fridays or thee weekend, as Añejo's fills up quickly and for a long time during peak hours and days.
